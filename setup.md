# Environment Setup

I have been setting up my development environment for years. Every time I buy a new machine (or perform a clean install of a new operating system) I go through the same setup. The issue is that my setup has yet to be documented and I spend a few weeks remembering things I have not installed or setup. This guide is meant to act as an evolving environment setup guide. This also will shed light on my setup and may give you ideas on what you can do to refine your setup.

I have thought about automating this, but I do not really see a need for automation at this time. This is a personal process that I usually take joy in performing.
