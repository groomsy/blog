      <h1>Environment Setup</h1>

<p>I have been setting up my development environment for years. Every time I buy a new machine (or perform a clean install of a new operating system) I go through the same setup. The issue is that my setup has yet to be documented and I spend a few weeks remembering things I have not installed or setup. This guide is meant to act as an evolving environment setup guide. This also will shed light on my setup and may give you ideas on what you can do to refine your setup.</p>

<p>I have thought about automating this, but I do not really see a need for automation at this time. This is a personal process that I usually take joy in performing.</p>

<p><em>Note: This article was triggered by the arrival of my new MacBook Air.</em></p>

<h2>Initial Boot</h2>

<p>Boot the machine and setup your account. Log into iCloud and setup <em>Find my Mac</em> and <em>iCloud Keychain</em>. Update any and all system software.</p>

<h2>Install Apple Software / Software from the Mac App Store</h2>

<p>The important software:</p>

<h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12">Xcode</a></h3>

<p>This is a no-brainer. I spend the overwhelming majority of my development time working on iOS projects or piddling with Mac projects.</p>

<h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gitbox/id403388357?mt=12">Gitbox</a></h3>

<p>I can use Git on the command line, but I would prefer not to. This is my favorite, no-frills Git GUI client.</p>

<h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/noteaway-your-thoughts-in/id559541463?mt=12">NoteAway</a></h3>

<p>A local Nashville developer wrote this software. It has quickly earned a spot in my menubar. The idea is dead simple: A notebook that sites in your menubar that is a keyboard shortcut away. Quickly paste in copied text or jot down ideas. I use it to track my line of thinking throughout my day so that I do not lose my place.</p>

<p>There are other pieces of software that I install, but these are the most important and the ones that I cannot function without.</p>
