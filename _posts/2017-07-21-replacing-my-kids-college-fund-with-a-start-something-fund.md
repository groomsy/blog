I understand wanting to provide opportunities to your kids, but this feels misguided. I think providing options is the most important thing one can do for their children. Max may not be like me, and that’s okay. Actually, that’s better than okay; it’s great.

This culture of entrepreneurship is good in small doses, but it’s hardly the silver bullet that people want it to be.

Having said that, the author’a idea is an interesting one. I just find it to be a bit shortsighted.
