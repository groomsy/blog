Lonely Planet recently had another featured app in the iOS App Store: [Make My Day](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/makemyday). This app is near and dear to my heart. Make My Day was one of the two apps that I worked on during my tenure at LP and was the one app that I worked on from start to finish (the other app that I worked on is slated for release later this year).

From what I can recall, this is the first app that I had a major hand in to be featured in the iOS App Store ([Slacker](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slacker-radio/id298307011?mt=8&uo=4&at=11lLcw) may have been featured, but I cannot recall; additionally, I would not classify the involvement I had as "major"). Being featured is very exciting for me. There are many developers for whom this would not matter or for whom this honor has been bestowed upon many times and has now lost its luster. Not me. I am going to enjoy this. It is another milestone in my career.

If you are inclined, I hope you will [check out Make My Day](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/make-my-day-by-lonely-planet/id920934435?mt=8&uo=4&at=11lLcw).
