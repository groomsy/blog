Me, at the end of my summary to Max on why we have Martin Luther King Jr day off from work and school: “Martin Luther King Jr wanted to ensure that everyone is treated equally and we take this day to remember what he did and what is still left to do. We should always treat people fair and with respect. Do you think you can treat all of your friends with kindness and respect?”

Max: “Yeah and I like to stomp my feet.”

Good talk.
