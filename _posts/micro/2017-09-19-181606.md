For silly reasons, I moved this site to be a Github Pages site. At first, I thought I would enjoy the git commit/push dance with writing posts. The novelty of this has worn off over time. I'm now in the process of writing a simple Swift CLI to post to my site. This CLI takes in a file, creates the file in my repo, then uploads the data associated with that file. It's an interesting way of using up my idle time to reinvent the wheel.
