Last week, Ashley found the back of the Land Rover had been egged. My guess is that it was probably perpetrated by some bored high school students. However, Ashley thinks it may have been in response to the Maple Leafs flag that hangs next to our garage. Either way, as far as I can tell we have done nothing to warrant this. I finished cleaning off the remnants today.
