One of the things Iâ€™m continually disappointed with are the prevalence of violent or scary commercials during sport telecasts. Narrowly avoided Max seeing the trailer for *It 2* while watching the Louisville/Notre Dame game last night. I find it confounding that we, as a society, allow violent television advertisements, but we blow a gasket over brief nudity.
