A few weeks ago, Ashley and I were watching John Oliver's piece on the state of Puerto Rico's economy. One of the contributing factors in Puerto Rico's current state is the limbo in which the territory finds itself. It's not quite a state and it's not quite a sovereign nation.

One of the more interesting revelations in the piece is that there were laws passed that hurt Puerto Rico that were buried in a larger bill. This intrigued me. My initial thought was, "Why would congress allow seemingly unrelated proposed laws in a larger bill?" I then immediately thought of all the terrible commits I've had in projects where I bury some seemingly innocuous change in a patch for a completely unrelated issue and it comes back to bite me on the ass. Suck.
