I have recently accepted a wonderful opportunity to work at [LunarLincoln](http://www.lunarlincoln.com) and I will be leaving my position at Lonely Planet, effective December 19th. This comes as a shock to me. I was not actively looking for a new job; I just happened to have stumbled into this serendipitous opportunity and, after a period of deliberation, have decided that the offer is too good to pass up. The founder of LunarLincoln is a good friend of mine and made me a generous offer to come work with friends. It was difficult for me to say "no" to that.

I thank Lonely Planet for everything they have given me: confidence, fond memories, and the chance to work with wonderfully talented developers. I wish everyone there nothing but the best.

With that said, I look forward to beginning my time at LunarLincoln in 2015.
