Ashley and I have been slowly going through our things, attempting to purge things we no longer need or just don't want. It's tough. What can be sold? What should be donated? What can be recycled? What should be thrown out? Much of our furniture has been accumulated since our marriage. Some pieces of furniture predate our first apartment together. A few pieces of furniture are cheap relics of college. Some of our stuff was slightly damaged during our move. Some of it has outlived its usefulness.

One of the items that I came across were a few pairs of eclipse sunglasses. I considered throwing them away, but felt terribly guilty about discarding something that was still useful. Instead, I found a [NASA article](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/what-to-do-with-your-solar-eclipse-glasses) that gave me a few options. I decided to ship them to the [Astronomers without Borders](https://astronomerswithoutborders.org) collection. It cause me the postage to ship them, but I feel a bit better about not wasting something that could still be used by someone.

It has always been difficult for me to part with my belongings. I feel guilt for giving away things that may have been a gift to me. However, I want to simplify our lives. We still have boxes of things that have not been unpacked since our move to California. I think it's time that those things, if possible, find new homes. I may have items that other people would be thankful to have. So I'll donate things that still have life in them, discard or recycle those that have been too well loved.
