![Prince](/images/prince.png "Prince Rogers Nelson")

I was generally aware of Prince and some of his music in high school. It wasn't something that I listened to, but I was aware of his more well known music. At an impressionable time of my life, my brother and I made a playlist of Prince songs. He was much more of a fan than I was and he set me up with a playlist of what he considered to be Prince's best work. That playlist blew my mind. The CD I burned that playlist to didn't leave my CD player for months. I listened to it for many hours. I loved the sound. I thought the lyrics were clever and very smart.

I don't really care if anyone reads this. This is for my own self-therapy. I came across Prince's work at a very important time in my life and it influenced my musical tastes for the rest of my life. I never met you. I never had the good fortune of seeing one of your shows. I enjoyed your work and it had a huge impact on me. Thank you.
