While listening to [Mark Maron's interview with the Director Richard Linklater on his WTF podcast](http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_566_-_richard_linklater), Linklater brought up an interesting mantra: "Pressure is a choice." Linklater heard this from former University of Texas pitcher Huston Street while filming *Inning by Inning*. In general, the idea is that everything in our lives is a choice. We choose what we focus on each day. If we can focus on the right things, then everything will fall into place. I feel like I need to change my focus onto things in my control and what I feel is important for my goals. It's easy to get bogged down in the everyday grind and to focus on the wrong things. I do it everyday.
