Landon Donovan \[is seemingly catching shit for "rooting" for Mexico\]([https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soccer-insider/wp/2018/06/17/landon-donovan-is-free-to-root-for-mexico-at-the-world-cup-now-about-how-hes-doing-it/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.a58ccc9b7495](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soccer-insider/wp/2018/06/17/landon-donovan-is-free-to-root-for-mexico-at-the-world-cup-now-about-how-hes-doing-it/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.a58ccc9b7495 "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soccer-insider/wp/2018/06/17/landon-donovan-is-free-to-root-for-mexico-at-the-world-cup-now-about-how-hes-doing-it/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.a58ccc9b7495")). I feel Donovan has the freedom to root for whichever team he wants to root for. This outcry against him for seemingly rooting for a rival is kind of bogus. The more insulting aspect of it is that its just part of an advertising campaign.

I personally would like to see Mexico do well in the World Cup (to hopefully bring respect to CONCACAF). As a casual fan, I do not share the history of a rivalry with Mexico. I just wish this all wasn't coming from an icky ad campaign from a crooked company.
