After finishing the light sequence, I modified the breadboard to wire an LED for each channel. Then I modified the Xmas.py script from the [Instructables walkthrough](https://www.instructables.com/Raspberry-Pi-Christmas-Tree-Light-Show/). I then grabbed an mp3 copy of _Let it Go_ from Amazon. Now I am in business.

The next step will be wiring up the relay and stringing up the lights.
