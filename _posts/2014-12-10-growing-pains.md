Even though I have been at this "dad thing" for ten months now (is he really that old already?), I am still learning new things about myself everyday. The latest thing I have learned about myself is the cause of my frustration when Max is upset: I am focused on doing something else. I believe that when I am thinking of something else I need to do (whether it be work or housework) I am more likely to become frustrated when he is fighting a nap or his bedtime. I am out of the moment. I am missing this time because I have something else on my mind.

I need to stop becoming so frustrated. I need to stop missing moments.
