I had a first while staying in a hotel on a recent trip. I usually try to leave a tip for the housekeeping staff. Even if it's a business trip, I'll try to leave a tip out of pocket. This trip was no different. The first morning, I left a tip on the nightstand. When I arrived back at my room, I realized that housekeeping had not entered the room (bed was not made, towels not cleaned up, etc). The tip was still on the nightstand. No big deal; the room was still clean and I don't need the bed made every day. I had plenty of towels and still had some coffee. The second morning, I left the same tip on the nightstand. When I arrived back at my room on the second evening, my bed was still not made, towels not cleaned up, coffee not restocked. However, this time, the tip was gone. ðŸ˜±

This was a first for me. It made me feel uneasy, but I reported the incident to the front desk. I'm still not really sure what to make of it.
