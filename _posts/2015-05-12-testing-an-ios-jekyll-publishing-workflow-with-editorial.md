After seeing [An iPad-Only Workflow for Creating Jekyll Posts ](http://thenewsprint.co/2015/01/29/an-ipadonly-workflow-for-creating-jekyll-posts/), I decided to try my own hand at it.

I purchased [Editorial](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/editorial/id673907758?mt=8&uo=6&at=11lLcw&ct=) and started accruing workflows. I downloaded a [New Jekyll Post](http://www.editorial-workflows.com/workflow/5819088383246336/lqX-GDUYaP4) workflow and made a few adjustments tailored to my site setup (namely asking for whether or not comments should be enabled and asking for tags). Next I found a [Publish Jekyll Post](http://www.editorial-workflows.com/workflow/5804054252879872/Ha5rVbz1fvM) workflow for publishing my posts to my Github repo. While these weren't perfect, I was able to learn how workflows in Editorial are built and I was able to customize these workflows to be more inline with how I work. I had been looking for a way to publish content to my site given my new Jekyll setup and I had been unhappy with what I had found. I had even contemplated writing my own app to accomplish this task (and I still might), but I think I'll give this a try for now.
