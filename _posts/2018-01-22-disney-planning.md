Ashley and I have been planning Max's first trip to Disney World. And by "Ashley and I have been planning", I really mean "Ashley has been planning". She has taken the initiative with this and it will be her first trip to Disney World as well. She accuses me of not being excited for our upcoming trip and she points to my lack of outward excitement and my lack of assistance with the planning. She is wrong; I am very excited for this trip.

I am looking forward to seeing his reaction when we tell him about our trip. I cannot wait to see his face light up as he explores the parks, to feel his excitement as we ride the rides together, and to see the inevitable smiles as we meet different characters. I have been to Disney World before, but I was so young I do not recall any of the trip, so I can only go by stories passed down to me from family about whether or not I had fun. Max is nearly four and we both feel as though he is old enough for this to be a memory for him as he ages. I only hope that it will be a positive one.

I would love to pretend I am a rare breed (we all like to believe we are unique). However, I am not really all that special. I can be fairly pessimistic during vacations (I would be very comfortable with Eeyore). I do not know if Max picks up on my pessimism yet, but I am fearful that he will start picking up on it soon. I am trying to improve, but I am scared that my sometimes sour moods will ruin our Disney trip. Maybe that is why I am not as outwardly excited as Ashley would like; I am distracted by concern and worry. If the happiest place on earth cannot break me from sour moods, what can?
