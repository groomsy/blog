My ten year high school reunion is scheduled for this Saturday. I am, begrudgingly, attending. Why begrudgingly you might ask? It's none of your stereotypical reasons. I wasn't bullied in high school. I was relatively popular. This is before I started spending most of my time in front of a computer screen, so I was fairly social. No, the sad truth is that I feel separated from my fellow graduates. I do not feel separated in an "I'm superior" way. I feel separated in an "I'm not sure what we have in common" way. I feel that the only connection I might have left with my fellow graduates is that we graduated from the same high school. Only one other person in my graduating class went to the same college as I attended (which, coincidentally, we decided to be roommates and he ended up becoming one of my closest friends in the process). Once we graduated high school, we went our separate ways and we have diverged quite a bit.

High school feels like a lifetime ago. I have graduated college (with a Bachelors and a Masters degree), adopted a dog, married the love of my life, purchased a home, renovated said home, changed jobs three times, and had a beautiful son (and that's just the high points). Never mind any of the setbacks I have encountered or the losses I have suffered.

What I forget in my reflection of the last ten years is that I am not the only one who has checked off these important life milestones.
