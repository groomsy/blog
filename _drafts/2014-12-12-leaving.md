![Rocket Man - Elton John](/images/elton-john-rocket-man.jpg "She packed my bags last night, pre-flight")

I'm beginning to gain a bit of a complex: I've recently accepted a wonderful opportunity at LunarLincoln and will be leaving my position at Lonely Planet. This comes as a shock to me. I wasn't actively looking for a new job. I happened to stumble into this serendipitous opportunity. The founder of LunarLincoln is a good friend of mine and made me a generous offer to come work with friends. It was difficult for me to say "no" to that.

I joke about the complex in the sense that it's difficult for me to accept that my expertise is that sought after. I feel that the "[imposter syndrome](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)" is an overused term, but I definitely struggle with it at times. Believing that you do not warrant the benefits or opportunities you are given is something that I have struggled with for a while (most of my career, in fact). I have, only recently, come to grips with the fact that I actually deserve the chances I have been given. It clicked for me when working on a difficult problem a few weeks ago. Instead of "hoping" I would find a solution, I fully "expected" to find a solution in due time. I knew I would find a solution. That was what it took to get over the hump for me: believing in myself.

I thank Lonely Planet for everything they have given me: confidence, fond memories, and the chance to work with wonderfully talented developers. I wish everyone there nothing but the best.

I look forward to beginning my time at LunarLincoln in 2015.
