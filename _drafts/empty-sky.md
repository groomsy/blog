I have always had a fairly eclectic taste in music for as long as I can remember. My mother and stepfather listened to what is now classified as Classic Rock. I fondly remember mimicking Steven Tyler to Aerosmith's _Permanent Vacation_ on vinyl. I still think Pink Floyd has made some of the best albums I have ever heard. Out of all the childhood memories I have of listening to my parents' music, the strongest is that of listening to Elton John's _Greatest Hits Volume II_ every morning for a few weeks during second grade.

I remember the cover of Elton John's _Greatest Hits Volume II_ vividly: Sir Elton dressed in cricket attire with a crescent moon in the background (funnily enough, when I was eight years old, I thought he was playing golf). I would pop the CD into my stepfather's Kenwood system and would jam. I absolutely loved _The Bitch is Back_, which I probably only liked at the time because of the questionable language in the title of the song.
