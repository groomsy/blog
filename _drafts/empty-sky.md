I have always had a fairly eclectic taste in music for as long as I can remember. My mother and stepfather listened to what is now classified as Classic Rock. I fondly remember mimicking Steven Tyler to Aerosmith's _Permanent Vacation_ on vinyl. I still think Pink Floyd has made some of the best albums I have ever heard.
