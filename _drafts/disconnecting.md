I have been checking out the last few months. I deactivated my Facebook account. I haven't opened my Twitter account in nearly a month. I've missed what's been happening on Reddit. I no longer receive notifications for every email I receive. I'm disconnecting.

It started as an experiment. I realized that I was habitually checking my phone when I should be spending time with my family. My son is already nine months old. I am revolted when I think about how much time I've wasted in his young life constantly watching my phone for things that haven't brought me that much pleasure.
